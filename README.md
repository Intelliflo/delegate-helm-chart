## Contributor License Agreement

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, Harness Inc. ("Harness") must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been read and followed by each contributor, indicating an agreement to the license terms [here](https://github.com/harness-apps/delegate-helm-chart/blob/main/Contributor_license_agreement.md). This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Harness; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.
